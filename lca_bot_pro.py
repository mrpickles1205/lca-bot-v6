            "This report presents an ISO-compliant life cycle assessment of one electric toothbrush. "
            "The goal is to assess its environmental impacts from cradle to grave. Key impact categories "
            "include energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption. Findings suggest that "
            "the manufacturing and end-of-life stages are most impactful. Improvement strategies are discussed."
        ),
        "1. Introduction": (
            "This Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. "
            "The aim is to assess and document the environmental footprint of an electric toothbrush product. "
            "This document provides structured analysis from material sourcing through disposal."
        ),
        "2. Goal and Scope": (
            "The LCA's objective is to evaluate the cradle-to-grave environmental performance of the product. "
            "Scope includes raw material extraction, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use phase, and end-of-life treatment."
        ),
        "3. Functional Unit": (
            "The functional unit is defined as one electric toothbrush used over a 3-year lifetime, assuming daily use "
            "and weekly recharging. All inputs and outputs are normalized to this unit."
        ),
        "4. System Boundary": (
            "The assessment uses a cradle-to-grave system boundary, including:
"
            "- Material extraction and processing
- Manufacturing and assembly
- Use phase (electricity consumption)
"
            "- Transportation and packaging
- End-of-life scenarios including recycling and landfill"
        ),
        "5. Inventory Analysis": (
            "The inventory includes material composition (plastic, metal, battery), manufacturing steps, transport energy, "
            "electricity use, and end-of-life disposal paths. Data is based on literature and approximations.
"
        ),
        "6. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)": (
            "LCIA converts inventory data into potential environmental impacts. Categories assessed:
"
            "- Energy demand (MJ)
- Global warming potential (kg CO2-eq)
- Water use (liters)
"
            "Methods used: ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) and IPCC 2021 for GWP.

Impact results are shown below."
        ),
        "7. Interpretation": (
            "The manufacturing stage contributes most to energy demand and emissions, largely due to battery and circuit "
            "production. End-of-life impact varies by disposal method. Use-phase energy is relatively minor but cumulative."
        ),
        "8. Assumptions and Limitations": (
            "Assumptions include average electricity grid mix, transport distances, and usage frequency. Limitations include "
            "lack of real supplier-specific data and end-of-life variability. Cutoff criteria: flows <5% impact excluded."
        ),
        "9. Recommendations": (
            "Design for disassembly, replaceable batteries, and recycled materials could significantly reduce impacts. "
            "Consumer education on e-waste recycling and product durability improvements are also recommended."
        ),
